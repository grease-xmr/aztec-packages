title: Running a Prover
description: A comprehensive guide on how to run an Aztec prover on the network using Docker Compose in a distributed configuration.
---

## Overview

This guide covers the steps required to run a prover on the Aztec network. Operating a prover is a resource-intensive role typically undertaken by experienced engineers due to its technical complexity and hardware requirements.

Aztec provers are critical infrastructure components. They generate cryptographic proofs attesting to transaction correctness, ultimately producing a single rollup proof submitted to Ethereum.

:::tip Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you've reviewed and completed the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) for the Docker Compose method.
:::

:::info Deployment Method
This guide uses the **Docker Compose method**. This is the recommended approach for prover nodes due to the complexity of managing distributed components.
:::

## Prover Architecture

The prover consists of three main components:

1. **Prover node**: Polls L1 for unproven epochs, creates prover jobs, distributes them to the broker, and submits the final rollup proof to the rollup contract.

2. **Prover broker**: Manages the job queue, distributing work to agents and collecting results.

3. **Prover agent(s)**: Executes proof generation jobs in a stateless manner.

## Minimum Requirements

### Prover Node

- 2 core / 4 vCPU (released in 2015 or later)
- 16 GB RAM
- 1 TB NVMe SSD
- 25 Mbps network connection

### Prover Broker

- 2 core / 4 vCPU (released in 2015 or later)
- 16 GB RAM
- 10 GB SSD

### Prover Agents

**For each agent:**
- 32 core / 64 vCPU (released in 2015 or later)
- 128 GB RAM
- 10 GB SSD

These requirements are subject to change as the network throughput increases. Prover agents require high-performance hardware, typically data center-grade infrastructure.

:::tip Running Multiple Agents
You can run multiple prover agents on a single machine by adjusting `PROVER_AGENT_COUNT`. Hardware requirements scale approximately linearly:
- **2 agents**: 64 cores, 256 GB RAM
- **3 agents**: 96 cores, 384 GB RAM
- **4 agents**: 128 cores, 512 GB RAM
:::

## Generating Keys

Before setting up your prover, you need to generate the required Ethereum private key for the prover publisher.

### Prover Publisher Private Key

The prover publisher key is used to submit proofs to L1. This account needs ETH funding to pay for L1 gas.

Generate an Ethereum private key using Foundry's `cast` tool:

```bash
# Generate a new wallet with a 24-word mnemonic
cast wallet new-mnemonic --words 24

# This outputs a mnemonic phrase, a derived address, and private key
# Save these securely - you'll need the private key for PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY
# and the address for PROVER_ID
```

**Important notes:**
- Save both the private key and the derived address securely
- The private key will be used for `PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- The derived Ethereum address will be used for `PROVER_ID`

:::warning Account Funding Required
The publisher account needs to be funded with ETH to post proofs to L1. Ensure the account holds sufficient ETH for gas costs during operation.
:::

:::tip
If you don't have Foundry installed, follow the installation guide at [getfoundry.sh](https://getfoundry.sh/).
:::

## Setup

The prover components are distributed across multiple machines for better performance and resource utilization. This setup runs multiple prover agents on separate high-performance machines, isolates the broker for better job queue management, and separates network-facing components (prover node) from compute-intensive components (agents).

### Architecture

- **Prover Node**: Runs on a machine with network access and L1 connectivity
- **Prover Broker**: Can run on the same machine as the prover node or separately (must be accessible from prover agents)
- **Prover Agents**: Run on separate high-performance machines (32+ cores each, scalable with `PROVER_AGENT_COUNT`)

:::warning Network Requirements
Prover agents must communicate with the prover broker over the network. Ensure that:

- The broker machine's port 8080 is accessible from all agent machines
- Firewall rules allow traffic between agents and broker
- Network connectivity is stable and low-latency between components
:::

### Prover Node and Broker Setup

On the machine that will run the prover node and broker:

#### Step 1: Set Up Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p aztec-prover-node/prover-node-data aztec-prover-node/prover-broker-data
cd aztec-prover-node
touch .env
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Prover Node Configuration
DATA_DIRECTORY=./prover-node-data
P2P_IP=[your external IP address]
P2P_PORT=40400
ETHEREUM_HOSTS=[your L1 execution endpoint]
L1_CONSENSUS_HOST_URLS=[your L1 consensus endpoint]
LOG_LEVEL=info
PROVER_BROKER_HOST=http://prover-broker:8080
PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY=[your prover publisher private key, see prerequisites]
AZTEC_PORT=8080
AZTEC_ADMIN_PORT=8880

# Prover Broker Configuration
PROVER_BROKER_DATA_DIRECTORY=./prover-broker-data
PROVER_BROKER_PORT=8080
```

#### Step 3: Create Docker Compose File

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
name: aztec-prover-node
services:
  prover-node:
    image: aztecprotocol/aztec:2.1.5
    entrypoint: >-
      node
      --no-warnings
      /usr/src/yarn-project/aztec/dest/bin/index.js
      start
      --prover-node
      --archiver
      --network testnet
    depends_on:
      prover-broker:
        condition: service_started
        required: true
    environment:
      DATA_DIRECTORY: /var/lib/data
      ETHEREUM_HOSTS: ${ETHEREUM_HOSTS}
      L1_CONSENSUS_HOST_URLS: ${L1_CONSENSUS_HOST_URLS}
      LOG_LEVEL: ${LOG_LEVEL}
      PROVER_BROKER_HOST: ${PROVER_BROKER_HOST}
      PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY: ${PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY}
      P2P_IP: ${P2P_IP}
      P2P_PORT: ${P2P_PORT}
      AZTEC_PORT: ${AZTEC_PORT}
      AZTEC_ADMIN_PORT: ${AZTEC_ADMIN_PORT}
    ports:
      - ${AZTEC_PORT}:${AZTEC_PORT}
      - ${P2P_PORT}:${P2P_PORT}
      - ${P2P_PORT}:${P2P_PORT}/udp
    volumes:
      - ${DATA_DIRECTORY}:/var/lib/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  prover-broker:
    image: aztecprotocol/aztec:2.1.5
    entrypoint: >-
      node
      --no-warnings
      /usr/src/yarn-project/aztec/dest/bin/index.js
      start
      --prover-broker
      --network testnet
    environment:
      DATA_DIRECTORY: /var/lib/data
      ETHEREUM_HOSTS: ${ETHEREUM_HOSTS}
      P2P_IP: ${P2P_IP}
      LOG_LEVEL: ${LOG_LEVEL}
    ports:
      - ${PROVER_BROKER_PORT}:8080
    volumes:
      - ${PROVER_BROKER_DATA_DIRECTORY}:/var/lib/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

:::warning Security: Admin Port Not Exposed
The admin port (8880) is intentionally **not exposed** to the host machine for security reasons. The admin API provides sensitive operations like configuration changes and database rollbacks that should never be accessible from outside the container.

If you need to access admin endpoints, use `docker exec`:
```bash
docker exec -it prover-node curl -X POST http://localhost:8880 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"nodeAdmin_getConfig","params":[],"id":1}'
```
:::

**Important:** The broker exposes port 8080 via `ports: - ${PROVER_BROKER_PORT}:8080`, making it accessible to external prover agents. Ensure this port is reachable from your agent machines.

This configuration includes only essential settings. The `--network testnet` flag applies network-specific defaults—see the [CLI reference](../reference/cli_reference.md) for all available configuration options.

#### Step 4: Start Node and Broker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Prover Agent Setup

On each machine that will run prover agents:

#### Step 1: Set Up Directory

```bash
mkdir aztec-prover-agent
cd aztec-prover-agent
touch .env
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
PROVER_AGENT_COUNT=1
PROVER_AGENT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=10000
PROVER_BROKER_HOST=http://[BROKER_MACHINE_IP]:8080
PROVER_ID=[address corresponding to PROVER_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY]
```

Replace `[BROKER_MACHINE_IP]` with the IP address of the machine running the prover broker.

**Agent configuration tips:**

- Set `PROVER_AGENT_COUNT` based on your machine's hardware (e.g., 64 cores/256 GB RAM = 2 agents, 96 cores/384 GB RAM = 3 agents, 128 cores/512 GB RAM = 4 agents)
- Test connectivity before starting: `curl http://[BROKER_MACHINE_IP]:8080`
- If the curl test fails, check your network configuration, firewall rules, and ensure the broker is running

#### Step 3: Create Docker Compose File

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
name: aztec-prover-agent
services:
  prover-agent:
    image: aztecprotocol/aztec:2.1.5
    entrypoint: >-
      node
      --no-warnings
      /usr/src/yarn-project/aztec/dest/bin/index.js
      start
      --prover-agent
      --network testnet
    environment:
      PROVER_AGENT_COUNT: ${PROVER_AGENT_COUNT}
      PROVER_AGENT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS: ${PROVER_AGENT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS}
      PROVER_BROKER_HOST: ${PROVER_BROKER_HOST}
      PROVER_ID: ${PROVER_ID}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Step 4: Start Agent

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Scaling your prover capacity:**

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more agent machines by repeating the agent setup on additional high-performance machines
- **Vertical scaling**: Increase `PROVER_AGENT_COUNT` on existing machines (ensure adequate hardware)

All agents, regardless of which machine they're on, must be able to communicate with the broker at the configured `PROVER_BROKER_HOST`.

## Verification

Once your prover is running, verify all components are working correctly:

### Check Services

On the prover node machine:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

On each agent machine:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

### View Logs

On prover node machine:
```bash
# Prover node logs
docker compose logs -f prover-node

# Broker logs
docker compose logs -f prover-broker
```

On agent machines:
```bash
# Agent logs
docker compose logs -f prover-agent
```

## Troubleshooting

### Components not communicating

**Issue**: Prover agent cannot connect to broker.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the broker IP address in `PROVER_BROKER_HOST` is correct
- Ensure port 8080 on the broker machine is accessible from agent machines
- Check firewall rules between machines allow traffic on port 8080
- Test connectivity from agent machine: `curl http://[BROKER_IP]:8080`
- Verify the broker container is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check if the broker port is exposed in docker-compose.yml
- Review broker logs for connection attempts: `docker compose logs prover-broker`

### Insufficient resources

**Issue**: Prover agent crashes or performs poorly.

**Solutions**:
- Verify your hardware meets the minimum requirements (32 cores per agent, 128 GB RAM per agent)
- Check system resource usage: `docker stats`
- Reduce `PROVER_AGENT_COUNT` if running multiple agents per machine
- Ensure no other resource-intensive processes are running
- Monitor CPU and memory usage to verify resources match your configured agent count

### Agent not picking up jobs

**Issue**: Agent logs show no job activity.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the broker is receiving jobs from the prover node
- Check broker logs for errors
- Confirm `PROVER_ID` matches your publisher address
- Ensure agent can reach the broker endpoint
- Test broker connectivity: `curl http://[BROKER_IP]:8080`

### Docker issues

**Issue**: Containers won't start or crash repeatedly.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are up to date
- Check disk space availability on all machines
- Verify `.env` files are properly formatted
- Review logs for specific error messages

### Common Issues

See the [Operator FAQ](../operation/operator_faq.md) for additional common issues and resolutions.
